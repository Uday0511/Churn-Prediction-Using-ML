Churn-Prediction-Using-ML

This project helps restaurants predict which customers might stop coming by using machine learning. It looks at customer data to find patterns that show who may leave. This way, the restaurant can take action early to keep those customers happy and coming back.

🍽️ Restaurant Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts if restaurant customers are likely to stop coming by analyzing their past behavior using machine learning. The main model used is the Random Forest algorithm, which is great at handling complex data and finding important patterns to predict churn accurately. 

To prepare the data and build the model, we use Python along with tools like Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Scikit-learn for creating and training the Random Forest. The predictions and insights are shown through an interactive dashboard built using Streamlit, making it easy to explore results and understand customer behavior. 

Visualizations are created with Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear charts, and trained models are saved and loaded with Pickle or Joblib. 

This setup helps restaurants take early steps to keep customers happy and reduce churn.
